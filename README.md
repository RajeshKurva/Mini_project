WATER QUALITY ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING
pH: Measured using a pH meter or pH test strips. A pH meter gives a precise reading of acidity or alkalinity on a 0-14 scale.

Chlorides: Measured using a titration kit with silver nitrate or an ion-selective electrode (ISE) for chloride.

Hardness (Calcium & Magnesium): Measured using a titration kit with EDTA reagent or a hardness tester.

Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): Measured with a TDS meter, which detects the concentration of dissolved substances in water.

Chloramines: Measured using colorimetric test kits or spectrophotometers, which detect the chloramine concentration by color change.

Sulfate: Measured using a turbidimetric method or a sulfate ion-selective electrode.

Electrical Conductivity: Measured using a conductivity meter, which detects how well the water conducts electricity.

Organic Carbon: Measured using a Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analyzer, which detects the amount of carbon in the water.

Trihalomethanes: Measured using gas chromatography to identify and quantify these chemical compounds.

Turbidity: Measured with a turbidimeter, which determines the clarity of water based on light scattering.
